## Setup

You'll first need to setup Snipcart & Printful before you can run the storefront locally, or deploy.

### 1. Setup Printful

<details>
  <summary>Login or create an account</summary>

You can [login](https://www.printful.com/auth/login), or [sign up](https://www.printful.com/auth/register) with Facebook, Google, Apple, and your email.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Create a new store</summary>
  
  You'll want to select **Manual order platform / API** from the available methods when [creating a new store](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Add products to your inventory</summary>
  
  Let's add a product to your store.

1. Select from over 200 hundred products which you would like to sell.
2. Configure the product design by adding your logo, selecting available colors, and sizes.
3. Next, proceed to mockups to select the image that will be shown in the storefront. You can select from people wearing your product, to flat wrinkled mockups. **Make sure to select `PNG` as your "mockup format" when creating your product.**
4. Next, proceed to details where you can name your product. This name will be shown in the storefront.
5. Next, proceed to pricing, and set some prices. Here you'll see the price it costs you, and the retail prices you'll charge your customers. You can quickly increase/decrease the profit margin here too.
6. **Save product**

That's it! üéâ Repeat this step for all products you want to sell.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't forget, shipping and taxes are extra!

‚ÑπÔ∏è You can optionally create a [**Product Template**](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/product-templates) for items you may want to add to additional stores later.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure selling preferences</summary>
  
  Inside **Settings** > **Stores**, you'll want to configure your default selling preferences. You can specify your selling region. You can opt to sell worldwide, and choose products from a wide variety of products, or you can set a specific region, such as the UK.

Depending on where you sell, you'll be liable to pay (or collect + pay) VAT. If you are VAT registered, provide Printful your VAT ID so orders can reflect a zero VAT amount where applicable.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you need to collect VAT from customers, make sure to enable the Tax API with Snipcart.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure shipping preferences</summary>
  
  Inside **Settings** > **Stores** > **Shipping**, you'll want to configure the USA & Europe settings.

The defaults should work for most, but you might want to make some adjustments for domestic and international shipping.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Enable API Access</summary>
  
Inside **Settings** > **Stores** > **API**, click to **Enable API Access**.

Make sure to copy your `API Key` for use later.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Add a billing method</summary>
  
You'll want to add a [billing method](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/billing-methods) to Printful so you can fulfill orders.

When a customer makes an order, Printful will charge YOU to process the order. üì∫ [Learn more how Printful processes payments for order fulfillment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lsHL8wji4&t=2s).

### 2. Setup Snipcart

### 3. Deploy

You'll need your `PRINTFUL_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY` to deploy.

## Running locally

Copy the example `env.local` file, and add the necessary ENV variables.

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

You'll next want to install the project dependencies, and start the local server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the storefront locally! üöÄ
